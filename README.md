# Google Search Tool

A Playwright-based Python tool that bypasses search engine anti-scraping mechanisms to execute Google searches and extract results. It can be used directly as a command-line tool or as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to provide real-time search capabilities to AI assistants like Claude.

      "snippet": "DeepSeek-R1 is now live and open source, rivaling OpenAI's Model o1. Available on web, app, and API. Click for details. Into ..."
    },
    {
      "title": "DeepSeek",
      "link": "https://www.deepseek.com/",
      "snippet": "DeepSeek-R1 is now live and open source, rivaling OpenAI's Model o1. Available on web, app, and API. Click for details. Into ..."

      "snippet": "We present DeepSeek-V3, a strong Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model with 671B total parameters with 37B activated for each token."
    }
    // More results...
  ]
}
```

#### HTML Output Example

When using the `--get-html` option, the output will contain HTML content-related information:

```json
{
  "query": "playwright automation",
  "url": "https://www.google.com/",
  "originalHtmlLength": 1291733,
  "cleanedHtmlLength": 456789,
  "htmlPreview": "<!DOCTYPE html><html itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/SearchResultsPage\" lang=\"zh-CN\"><head><meta charset=\"UTF-8\"><meta content=\"dark light\" name=\"color-scheme\"><meta content=\"origin\" name=\"referrer\">..."
}
```

If you also use the `--save-html` option, the output will also include the HTML saved file path:

```json
{
  "query": "playwright automation",
  "url": "https://www.google.com/",
  "originalHtmlLength": 1292241,
  "cleanedHtmlLength": 458976,
  "savedPath": "./google-search-html/playwright_automation-2025-04-06T03-30-06-852Z.html",
  "screenshotPath": "./google-search-html/playwright_automation-2025-04-06T03-30-06-852Z.png",
  "htmlPreview": "<!DOCTYPE html><html itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/SearchResultsPage\" lang=\"zh-CN\">..."
}
```

### MCP Server

This project provides Model Context Protocol (MCP) server functionality, allowing AI assistants like Claude to directly use Google search capabilities. MCP is an open protocol that enables AI assistants to securely access external tools and data.

#### Integration with Claude Desktop

1. Edit Claude Desktop configuration file
   - Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
     - Usually located at `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
     - You can enter `%APPDATA%\Claude` in Windows Explorer address bar to access directly

2. Add server configuration and restart Claude

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-search": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["mcp_server_simple.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

After integration, you can directly use search functionality in Claude, such as "Search for the latest AI research".

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.8+**: Development language, providing excellent performance and compatibility
- **Playwright**: For browser automation, supporting multiple browsers
- **MCP SDK**: For implementing MCP server development tools
- **asyncio**: Python's standard library for asynchronous I/O
- **aiofiles**: Asynchronous file operations

## Development Guide

All commands can be run in the project root directory:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers
playwright install chromium

# Run CLI tool
python cli.py "search keywords"

# Start MCP server
python mcp_server_simple.py

# Test MCP client
python mcp_client_enhanced.py
```

## Error Handling

The tool has built-in robust error handling mechanisms:

- Provides friendly error information when browser startup fails
- Automatically returns error status when network connection issues occur
- Provides detailed logs when search result parsing fails
- Gracefully exits and returns useful information in timeout situations

## Notes

### General Notes

- This tool is for learning and research purposes only
- Please comply with Google's terms of service and policies
- Don't send requests too frequently to avoid being blocked by Google
- Some regions may require proxies to access Google
- Playwright requires browser installation, which will be automatically downloaded on first use

### State Files

- State files contain browser cookies and storage data, please keep them safe
- Using state files can effectively avoid Google's anti-bot detection and improve search success rate

### MCP Server

- When using MCP server, please ensure Claude Desktop is updated to the latest version
- When configuring Claude Desktop, please use absolute paths pointing to MCP server files

### Windows Environment Special Notes

- In Windows environment, first run may require administrator privileges to install Playwright browsers
- If you encounter permission issues, try running Command Prompt or PowerShell as administrator
- Windows Firewall may block Playwright browser network connections, please allow access when prompted
- Browser state files are saved by default in the user's home directory under `.google-search-browser-state.json`
- Log files are saved in the system temporary directory under `google-search-logs` folder

## Comparison with Commercial SERP APIs

Compared to paid search engine results API services (such as SerpAPI), this project provides the following advantages:

- **Completely Free**: No API call fees required
- **Local Execution**: All searches are executed locally, no dependency on third-party services
- **Privacy Protection**: Search queries are not recorded by third parties
- **Customizability**: Completely open source, can be modified and extended as needed
- **No Usage Restrictions**: Not subject to API call count or frequency limitations
- **MCP Integration**: Native support for integration with AI assistants like Claude

## Anti-Bot Protection

This project implements multiple layers of anti-bot protection:

### Client Level Protection
- Request interval control with random delays
- Timeout protection for tool calls
- Intelligent error handling

### Server Level Protection
- Request frequency limiting
- Random delays between requests 
- Global request counting and management

### Search Level Protection
- Browser fingerprint randomization
- Device and locale randomization
- Browser state management
- Automatic CAPTCHA detection and handling

## Performance

- **Response Time**: Typically 5-15 seconds
- **Success Rate**: 95%+ (with state files)
- **Concurrency**: Supports asynchronous operations
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized with cleanup after each call
- **Stability**: Robust error recovery and timeout handling
